## Release 0.2.1 ##

Now using org.btelman:FFmpegAndroid:0.4.0 for FFmpeg via https://dl.bintray.com/btelman96/maven

Same code, but now hosted on bintray to make it be automatically grabbed when using the streaming module

## Release 0.2.0 ##

Restructured entire project to have all of the sdk related modules under
the sdk folder.

Bintray integration.

To use this sdk without importing, add this to repos:

```
        maven {
            url  "https://dl.bintray.com/btelman96/maven"
        }
```

Then add each desired module to the dependencies.

```
    def controlsdk_version = "0.2.0"
    api "org.btelman.controlsdk:core:$controlsdk_version"
    api "org.btelman.controlsdk:streaming:$controlsdk_version"
    api "org.btelman.controlsdk:hardware:$controlsdk_version"
    api "org.btelman.controlsdk:texttospeech:$controlsdk_version"
    api "org.btelman.controlsdk:networking:$controlsdk_version" //currently empty, may be removed in the future
```

Mixing versions is not supported, even though not all versions may have touched code in a different module.

The only requirement is core, all other are optional, as custom classes can interface with it

## Release 0.1.0 ##

Initial release. Structure or API may change a lot in the future. This is a first working prototype,
but may not be optimal for use yet

See the app demo classes to see how to use certain features
